# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Data Analysis & Recommendation System

This project explores and analyzes a Netflix dataset using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. It also includes a **content-based recommendation system** built using **TF-IDF Vectorizer** and **cosine similarity**, and deployed as a simple web app using **Streamlit**.

- Build a **content-based recommendation system** using:
  - `description` + `genre` text fields

# ðŸ§  Recommendation Logic
I used the description and listed_in fields of Netflix titles, combined them into a single string, vectorized using TF-IDF, and calculated cosine similarity to recommend shows/movies similar to the userâ€™s selected title.

# ðŸ“Œ Dataset
This dataset was sourced from publicly available Netflix content data (kaggle). It contains metadata such as title, type, genre, director, cast, country, date added, rating, and description.
